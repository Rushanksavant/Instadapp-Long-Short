### Long/Leverage :

A leveraged position on an asset is taken when it is expected for the asset price to go up sooner or later. Leveraged or Long position is basically buying more of that asset before, and selling it after the price rise, hence making a profit on price difference. 

**Using Compound:**

- Let's say you have 100$ worth ETH in your wallet, and it's expected that for ETH price to rise in comming days
- You deposit your 100$ worth ETH in Coumpound protocol
- Compund allows you to borrow against the asset you deposit, hence you borrow 50$ worth ETH against your deposit.
- After few days, the ETH price goes up by 10%.
- The ETH you deposited in Compound is now worth 110$, and the ETH you borrowed is now worth 55$.
- This makes you a profit of 15$.
- But let's say you had just hold the ETH in your wallet and not deposit in Compound, the profit then would be just 10$.
