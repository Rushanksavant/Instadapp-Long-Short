### Long/Leverage :

A leveraged position on an asset is taken when it is expected for the asset price to go up sooner or later. Leveraged or Long position is basically buying more of that asset before, and selling it after the price rise, hence making a profit on price difference. 

**Using Compound:**

- Let's say you have 100$ worth ETH in your wallet, and it's expected that for ETH price to rise in comming days
- You deposit your 100$ worth ETH in Coumpound protocol
- Compund allows you to borrow against the asset you deposit, hence you borrow 50$ worth ETH against your deposit.
- Now you deposit all of it (50$ worth ETH) again to Compound as collateral.
- And then repeat this a few times:
    - borrow 25$ worth ETH and deposit it back to Compound 
    - borrow 12.5$ worth ETH and deposit it back to Compound 
- Doing this you have created a 3x leveraged position.
